## batik-classification

This repository contains the implementation of a fine-grained image recognition system using deep learning for classifying five Javanese batik motifs including Kawung, Megamendung, Parang, Sidomukti, and Truntum. The project focuses on comparing a lightweight and efficient architecture, EfficientNetV2-B0, with a widely used baseline model, ResNet-50.
